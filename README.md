### Hey there, I'm Srishti Dasarathy, PhD Candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a polar data scientist currently working on Southern Ocean-scale research, & I'm hoping to complete my PhD in the next couple of years! My research focuses on understanding high latitude tropospheric marine aerosol arising from biological and physical variables, and I've also uncovered major seasonal dynamics of primary producers and sea ice. 

To do this work, I utilize multiple years of data from NASA Earth-observing satellites, particularly CALIPSO & MODIS, through which I'm able to examine patterns across the Southern Ocean. I also have a new upcomining project where I'll be using modeled data from the Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate to examine how changing sea ice conditions in the western Antarctic Peninsula influences primary producers. 

- ðŸŒ± Most of my coding expertise is in MATLAB, NCL, and I have some experience with R as well. Iâ€™m currently teaching myself SQL & Python!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to network and explore what a future career might look like!

- ðŸ’ƒ: Extracurriculars: I can't sit still. Beyond my graduate study, I've also worked to represent the interests of students and been elected as Student Representative and later as Co-Chair of the SIO Graduate Student Council. I'm now learning outside of my role as a graduate student as the Scripps Industry Relations & Innovation Fellow at startBlue!
